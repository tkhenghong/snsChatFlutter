# The following section is specific to Flutter.
# YOU MUST PUT assets: with indentation RIGHT BENEATH THE flutter: key, or else everything won't work
flutter:
  assets:
    - lib/ui/images/
    - lib/ui/icons/
    - lib/keystore/

  #- family: Roboto & Raleway
  fonts:
    - family: Raleway
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/fonts/Raleway-Italic-VariableFont_wght.ttf
        - asset: lib/fonts/Raleway-VariableFont_wght.ttf
          style: normal
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
        - asset: lib/fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.io/custom-fonts/#from-packages
